Project 3: Discount vs Rating Causation Analysis

File Name: discount_vs_rating_causation_analysis.pbix
Tool Used: Power BI

Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes whether higher discounts genuinely improve customer satisfaction or mainly increase sales volume. The study evaluates the relationship between:

Avg Discount Percentage
Avg Rating
Review Volume

Scatter plots with regression trend lines are used to identify correlation patterns and assess whether rating improvements are directly caused by discounts or indirectly influenced by increased sales activity.

Key Insight

Although discounts show a positive relationship with ratings, a stronger relationship exists between discount and review volume. Ratings tend to improve as review count increases, indicating that higher ratings are more influenced by increased sales volume (social proof effect) rather than direct improvement in product quality.

Tools Used
